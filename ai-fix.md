## CI/CD Build Error Diagnosis & Suggested Fixes

### Error Overview
The error log indicates that the `npm` command has failed due to a missing script for the `test` command. Specifically, the error message is:

```
npm error Missing script: "test"
```

This means that the `package.json` file does not contain an entry under the `scripts` section for the `test` command, which is necessary for running tests during the CI/CD process.

### Suggested Fixes

To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that your `package.json` file includes a `test` script. Follow the steps below:

1. **Open `package.json`:** Locate and open your project's `package.json` file.

2. **Check the `scripts` Section:**
   Look for the scripts section in `package.json`. It usually looks something like this:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "node index.js",
     "build": "webpack"
   }
   ```

3. **Add the `test` Script:**
   If there is no `test` script present, you will need to add one. A simple example of a `test` script that uses Jest (assuming you are using Jest for testing) could be:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "node index.js",
     "build": "webpack",
     "test": "jest"
   }
   ```

   If you are using a different testing framework (such as Mocha, Jasmine, etc.), replace `"jest"` with the appropriate command for your testing tool.

4. **Save the Changes:** After adding the appropriate `test` script to the `scripts` section, save your changes to `package.json`.

5. **Run Tests Locally:**
   Run the following command in your terminal to ensure everything is working locally:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

6. **Commit and Push Changes:**
   Once verified, commit the changes to your version control system and push them to your repository. This will trigger the CI/CD pipeline again.

### Example of a Complete `package.json`
Here is an example of what your updated `package.json` might look like after adding the test script:

```json
{
  "name": "your-project-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "build": "webpack",
    "test": "jest" // Added test script
  },
  "dependencies": {
    // your dependencies here
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "jest": "^27.0.0" // Example dependency for Jest
  }
}
```

### Conclusion
By ensuring that a `test` script is present in your `package.json`, you will resolve the missing script error during the CI/CD build process. This will allow the continuous integration system to properly run your tests. If you have any specific commands or frameworks you're using for testing, adjust the `test` script accordingly.
