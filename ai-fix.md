# CI/CD Build Error Diagnosis and Fix Suggestions

## Error Details
During the test stage of your CI/CD pipeline, the following error occurred:

```
npm error Missing script: "test"
```

This indicates that the npm command is attempting to execute a script named `"test"` that is not defined in your `package.json`.

## Diagnosis
The error message clearly states that the `"test"` script is missing from your `package.json`. NPM uses this script to run tests defined for your application. When the `npm test` command is executed, it looks for a script section in `package.json` which does not exist in this case.

## Suggested Fixes

### Step 1: Check the `package.json`
1. Open your `package.json` file located at the root of your project.
2. Look for a section labeled `"scripts"`. If it does not exist, or if there is no `"test"` script defined, you will need to add one.

### Step 2: Define the Test Script
Add a `"test"` script in the `"scripts"` section. The content of this script will depend on the testing framework and tools you are using (such as Jest, Mocha, or your custom test command). An example definition can be:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

If you are using a different testing framework, replace `jest` with the appropriate command. Here are some examples for common testing frameworks:

- **Jest:**
  ```json
  "test": "jest"
  ```

- **Mocha:**
  ```json
  "test": "mocha"
  ```

- **Custom Command:**
  If you have a custom command, simply replace `jest` with that command.

### Step 3: Verify Your Changes
1. After making changes, save the `package.json` file.
2. Run `npm run` in your terminal to confirm that the `test` command is now listed among the available scripts.
3. Execute `npm test` to ensure that your tests run successfully without errors.

### Additional Recommendations
- **Check for Existing Tests:** If you do not have any tests written, consider adding some to ensure your application is working as expected.
  
- **Consult Documentation:** If you are unsure of the command you need for your testing framework, refer to its official documentation for detailed instructions and options.

- **Install Necessary Packages:** Ensure that your testing framework is installed in your project. You may need to run `npm install <testing-framework>` (e.g., `npm install jest`).

## Conclusion
By following the steps above, you should be able to resolve the error regarding the missing `"test"` script. This will enable your CI/CD pipeline to progress past the test phase successfully. If you continue to face issues, inspect your configuration files and ensure all dependencies are installed correctly.
