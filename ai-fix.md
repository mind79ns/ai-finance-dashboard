# CI/CD Build Error Diagnosis and Fix Suggestion

## Error Overview
The error log indicates that the npm command failed due to a missing "test" script in your `package.json` file. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the error message:

```
npm error Missing script: "test"
```

This error occurs when you attempt to run `npm test`, but no `"test"` script is defined in your project's `package.json`.

## Steps to Resolve the Issue

### Step 1: Verify the `package.json` File
1. Open your project's `package.json` file, located in the root directory of your project.
2. Look for the `scripts` section. It should look something like this:

```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "build": "npm run build",
    "test": "your-test-command-here"    // This line is required
}
```

### Step 2: Add the Missing "test" Script
If the `"test"` script is missing, you will need to add it. Depending on your testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha, etc.), modify your `package.json` as follows:

1. **For Jest**:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
       "test": "jest",
       ...
   }
   ```

2. **For Mocha**:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
       "test": "mocha",
       ...
   }
   ```

3. **For a Custom Test Command**:
   If you have a custom command to run tests, you can specify it directly. For example:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
       "test": "node tests/test.js",
       ...
   }
   ```

### Step 3: Save Changes
After making the necessary changes:
- Save the `package.json` file.

### Step 4: Re-run the CI/CD Process
Go back to your CI/CD system and trigger the build or deployment process again. You should no longer encounter the "missing script" error.

## Additional Considerations
- **Check Existing Scripts**: If you already have tests but they're defined under a different name, consider renaming that script to `"test"` for consistency or update the command you run (i.e., using the current script's name).
- **Run `npm run` Locally**: You can execute `npm run` locally in your terminal to see all available scripts, ensuring you know what scripts are defined.

## Conclusion
By adding the `"test"` script to your `package.json`, you should ensure that your CI/CD pipeline can execute the tests as part of the build process. If you continue to encounter issues after this fix, please check the specific test command and its syntax or dependencies needed for testing.
